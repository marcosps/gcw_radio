OpenDingux Radio Player
-----------------------
	This application is a radio player for OpenDingux.

------
STATUS
------
	This application is under development. Updates will come
	very quick.

--------
DOWNLOAD
--------
	You can download the executable from:
	https://github.com/downloads/marcosps/radio_player/radio_player_v0.1.tar

	You can also clone the repository by:
	git clone https://github.com/marcosps/radio_player.git

-----------
COMPILATION
-----------
	After clone the repo(or download the source code) you can compile the radio player
	code. To do that, you will need the OpenDingux toolchain[1], and will need to setup you
	environment[2].

	Aftet this, you can enter in the dir, and do a simply 'make'. It will compile the source code.

------------
INSTALLATION
------------
	If you download the executable, you can extract the .tar file and put this in your SD card.
	
	If you compile the code, a tar file will be created with the name radio_player_v0.1.tar.
	You can extract this tar file and put the content in your SD card.

	After put the executables in the SD card you just need to make a link in the menu of OpenDingux
	pointing to the radio.dge file(in the same dir that you put before).
